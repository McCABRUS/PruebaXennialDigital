### Dynamic Tutorial pages

The project allows to load a tutorial made with images before starting the actual game. The number of images loaded are unlimited, for run propertly the following rules must be done:

  - All the images should be saved in the folder Content/pagesImg. (Build or Project view).
  - The images name must be ONLY the number of the page.
  - The image format must be jpg (lowcase).
  - All files that not follow the previous steps will be ignored.
  - If there is no image name that follows the sequence (i.e 1,2,3,5) the program will assume the are no more pages to be loaded.
  - Is recommended to upload 2:1 images.

The tutorial images can be added or removed any time without compile or change anything from the project files.
